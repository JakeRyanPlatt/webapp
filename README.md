# Experimental Python Tools

A collection of experimental, exploratory, and sometimes half-baked Python tools, scripts, and utilities.

This repository serves as a sandbox for prototyping ideas, testing concepts, and building small tools that may eventually graduate into standalone projects—or be discarded entirely.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- Code in this repository is **experimental**.
- APIs, behavior, and structure may change at any time.
- Some tools may be incomplete, inefficient, or intentionally rough.
- Use at your own risk.

## 📦 Contents

The repository may include:
- Small standalone scripts
- Proof-of-concept implementations
- Developer utilities
- Automation experiments
- Data processing or analysis tools
- One-off hacks and prototypes

Each tool or experiment typically lives in its own directory or file and may have its own minimal documentation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (unless stated otherwise)
- Additional dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` or alongside individual tools

### Setup

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd experimental-python-tools
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
